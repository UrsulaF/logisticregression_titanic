# Titanic Logistic Regression Project

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project focuses on building a Logistic Regression model using the Titanic dataset. It serves as a comprehensive study material aimed at deepening the understanding of the mathematical foundations behind logistic regression, as well as its practical applications. 

## ðŸ“Š Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore the concept of logistic regression in depth, particularly focusing on:
- The mathematical formulation of logistic regression.
- The sigmoid function and its significance in predicting probabilities.
- Building and evaluating a logistic regression model using the `statsmodels` library.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand its features.
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Explaining the logistic regression formula and the role of the sigmoid function.
- **Model Implementation**: Using the `statsmodels` library to implement and evaluate the logistic regression model.
- **Results Interpretation**: Discussing the output of the model and its implications.
